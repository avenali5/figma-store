            Any and all profits we generate from the store will be used to
            purchase carbon removal credits via reforestation from TIST (The
            International Small Group and Tree Planting Program). TIST is an
            innovative time-tested reforestation program that supports

            sustainable development and climate change through education and
            tree planting.
